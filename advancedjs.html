    <main>
        <div class="jsexample">
            <h2>Feature 1: Date Picker</h2>
            <p>In this example I will show you how a simple date input field can be turned into a more advance datepicker allowing the user to select dates from a dropdown calender.</p>
            <br>
            <label>Select a date:</label>
            <input type="text" id="datepicker">
        </div>
        <div class="jsexample">
            <h2>Feature 2: 3D Model</h2>
            <p>In this example I will show you a 3D model of a phone than could be uised to show customers what courtesy phone they will be recieving, although it wont add any functionality to the web page, it will enhance the user experience for the customer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jsexample">
            <h2>Feature 3: Store Map & GeoLocation</h2>
            <p>A map could be added to the web page showing the user where store locations are, and by using thier goelocation it would potentially show them optimal routes and an estimate of how long it would take to get to each store.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jsexample">
            <h2>Feature 4: Drag and Drop</h2>
            <p>This is another feature for the courtesy phone section that would let users drag what phone they want into a 'basket' and would replace the current method of using a drop down button click menu.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jsexample">
            <h2>Feature 5: Web Storage</h2>
            <p>Finally this example shows how local storage can be used to store data and pass them to another webpage, or in this exapmple back to the user.</p>
        </div>
